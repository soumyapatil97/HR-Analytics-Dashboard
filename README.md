HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI

## üìä Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI. The goal is to provide a clear and interactive overview of key human resources metrics, with a primary focus on understanding employee attrition. By transforming raw employee data into actionable insights, this dashboard helps stakeholders identify trends, pinpoint problem areas, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

## üéØ Key Objectives & Problem Statement

The primary objective was to analyze the employee dataset of a company to uncover the factors leading to employee attrition. The key business questions this dashboard answers are:

* What is the overall attrition rate?
* Which departments, job roles, or demographics have the highest attrition rates?
* What is the relationship between salary, years at the company, and attrition?
* How do performance ratings correlate with employee turnover?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools

* **Data Analysis:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* **Data Transformation (ETL):** Power Query
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI Desktop
* **Data Source:** [e.g., CSV file from Kaggle, a synthetic dataset you created, etc.]

## üîÑ Project Workflow

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Imported the dataset into Power BI. Used Power Query Editor to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types for consistency and accuracy.

2.  **Data Transformation:** Created new calculated columns (e.g., age groups, tenure buckets) and conditional columns to enrich the dataset for deeper analysis.

3.  **Data Modeling:** Designed a simple data model, establishing relationships between tables where necessary.

4.  **DAX Calculations:** Wrote several key DAX measures to calculate metrics such as:
    * `Total Employees`
    * `Total Attrition`
    * `Attrition Rate (%)`
    * `Average Tenure`

5.  **Dashboard Design:** Created a multi-page interactive dashboard with a clean and intuitive user interface. The report includes:
    * An **Executive Summary** page with key KPIs.
    * A **Demographics** page to analyze attrition by age, gender, and education.
    * A **Departmental Analysis** page to drill down into specific job roles and departments.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Insights

* **Interactive Filters:** Users can dynamically filter the entire report by Department, Job Role, Gender, and more.
* **Attrition Analysis:** Identified that [e.g., the Sales department has the highest attrition rate, and employees with lower job levels are more likely to leave].
* **Performance vs. Attrition:** The analysis revealed a correlation between [e.g., lower performance ratings and a higher likelihood of attrition].
